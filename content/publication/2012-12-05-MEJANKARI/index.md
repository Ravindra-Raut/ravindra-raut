<p style='text-align: justify;'>abstract: " Sericulture is a labor-intensive agro-based rural industry and covers silkworm food plants, silkworm rearing, silk reeling, spinning, yarn twisting, dyeing, weaving, printing, finishing, and related processes. In the year 2010-11, the sericulture sector's employment increased to 72.5 lakh persons in India (i.e., 52.20 lakh farmers, 3.70 lakh reelers, and 16.60 lakh weavers) from 68.17 lakh persons during 2009-10. Approximately  89% of the silk produced in India is mulberry silk. The total area under mulberry plantation was 1.70 lakh hectares during 2010-11. Production of raw mulberry silk was 16360 MT, including Bivoltine (1400 MT). Moreover, Crossbreed (14960 MT). Other Vanya raw silk production was 4050 MT, which includes Tasar (1166 MT), Eri (2760 MT), and Muga (124M.T.).Thus raw silk production during 2010-11 was 20410MT.</p>

#Raw silk export:#
<p style='text-align: justify;'>During 2010-11India exported Rs.2723.86 Crores of raw silk. The items of silk exported include natural silk yam fabrics, made-ups (1578.40 Crores), readymade garments (1095.1 Crores), silk carpets (15.84 Crores), and silk waste (34.52 Crores). India exports raw silk mainly to Hong Kong (Rs 6188 million), the USA (Rs 3703.5 million), UK (Rs 2528.4 million), UAE (Rs 2391.1 million), and Germany (Rs1388.4 million).</p>
#State-wise Mulberry raw silk production:#
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Karnataka is the topmost producer with 7,360 MT, followed by Andhra Pradesh (5119MT), West Bengal (1865MT), Tamil Nadu (1233MT), and Jammu & Kashmir (110MT) during 2009-10.</p>
#State-wise Vanya raw silk production:#
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Jharkhand (404MT), Chhattisgarh (161MT), Madhya Pradesh (74MT), and Orissa (71MT) are the leading tropical Tasar silk producing states. Assam (1410MT), Meghalaya (450MT), Manipur (280MT), and Nagaland (250MT) are the primary Eri silk producing states.  Assam (93MT) and Meghalaya (10MT) are the large producers of eri silk compare to other north-east states of India (2009-10 data).</p>
#Raw silk import:#
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To meet the domestic demand for raw silk, India imports silk from other countries. The total volume of imports during 2010-11 was 5870 tonnes valued at INR 9384.4 million. Apart from raw silk, India also imports natural silk yarn and silk fabrics. India imported natural silk yarn worth INR 1473.7 million and Rs.6201.6 million of fabrics during 2010-11. In 2010-11 India imported raw silk from China 5591 tones (valued INR 9078.6 million), Uzbekistan 126 tones (valued INR 96.5 million), Vietnam 31 tones (valued INR 29.4 million), Malaysia 25 tones (valued INR 30.9 million), Thailand 19 tones (valued INR 29.3 million) and other countries 78 tones (valued INR 119.7 million)."</p>
